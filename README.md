# MASK-DETECTION
In this tutorial, you will learn how to train a COVID-19 face mask detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

Readers really enjoyed learning from the timely, practical application of that tutorial, so today we are going to look at another COVID-related application of computer vision, this one on detecting face masks with OpenCV and Keras/TensorFlow.

In this tutorial, we’ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

# Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

1.Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
2.Detect face masks in real-time video streams
We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our face mask detector.

I’ll also provide some additional suggestions for further improvement.
